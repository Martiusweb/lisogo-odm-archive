class AbstractDocument(object):
    """
    An `AbstractDocument` represents an object that can be converted and stored
    as a document in a mongodb instance.

    This class is an Abc.

    You must override the method :meth:`collection`.

    The idea here is to provide a set of handful methods and helpers in order
    to persist objects in mongodb without spending much time working with an
    ODM.

    Currently, this class only support a first-level mapping between a
    dictionary and the object properties.

    :meth:`toSON` will insert into a dictionary the object members which are
    not methods, not in the list of :prop:`_ignoredFields` and not starting
    by an underscore `_`. The only exception to this rule is the property
    `_id`, which is used to store the document identifier from mongodb.
    A custom `_type` field is added to the son representation, containing the
    class name of `self`.

    :meth:`fromSON` is the reverse operation, it populates the object's members
    with those in the dictionary.

    Nested documents and references are not yet supported (but will come soon,
    I guess).
