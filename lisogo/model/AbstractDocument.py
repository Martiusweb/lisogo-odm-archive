    An `AbstractDocument` represents an object that can be converted and stored
    as a document in a mongodb instance.

    This class is an Abc.

    You must override the method :meth:`collection`.

    The idea here is to provide a set of handful methods and helpers in order
    to persist objects in mongodb without spending much time working with an
    ODM.

    Currently, this class only support a first-level mapping between a
    dictionary and the object properties.

    :meth:`toSON` will insert into a dictionary the object members which are
    not methods, and not starting by an underscore `_`. The only exception to
    this rule is the property `_id`, which is used to store the document
    identifier from mongodb. A custom `_type` field is added to the son
    representation, containing the class name of `self`.

    :meth:`fromSON` is the reverse operation, it populates the object's members
    with those in the dictionary.

    Nested documents and references are not yet supported (but will come soon,
    I guess).
